# Botathon
## A hackathon focused on chatbots & AI

Resources for building chatbots (messaging bots) 
with AI (Artificial Intelligence) platforms.

### Intro
A new paradigm is rocking the mobile world. It’s the unstoppable shift to AI and intelligent messaging (i.e. chatbots), away from apps as we know them. It’s changing the way we use our devices, and it’s allowing brands to intercept customers with more immediacy and ease than ever.

### Quick up and running for non-coders (drag and drop visual chatbot building)

### Quick up and running for (JavaScript) developers
1. Have/get/learn [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Learn and install [botkit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit)
3. Pick a messaging platform (see below), follow botkit's examples, play & learn hands-on (For quick and easy dev setup, use secure tunnels to localhost like https://ngrok.com/ or https://localtunnel.me/ and for quick and easy SSL on the deployment env, consider https://letsencrypt.org/)
